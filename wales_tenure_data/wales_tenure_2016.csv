"General description","Estimates of the number of dwellings in Wales by tenure and for each local authority, as at 31 March each year."
"Data collection and calculation","Estimates of the number of  dwellings are based on data from the 2001, 2011 and 2021 population censuses, updated annually to take account of dwelling stock through new build completions plus any gains or losses through conversations and demolitions. 

This method of 'rolling forward' the estimates from a census provides estimates between the census years. However, after rolling forward estimates for 10 years, discrepancies are usually observed between the rolled forward estimates and the next census figures. The rolled forward method, whilst the best available methodology between censuses, is likely to produce less reliable estimates for years further away from the census base.

Figures for 2012 to 2020 have been revised following the publication of the 2021 Census.  Please see the statistical release for further information.

The tenure split for Wales between owner-occupied and privately rented dwellings has been estimated using information from the Annual Population Survey (APS). Full details of the methodology are in the statistical release."
"Frequency of publication","Annual"
"Data reference periods","2000-01 onwards. Financial years.With the exception of Census years, the estimates presented relate to the end of each financial year i.e. estimates for 2022 relate to 31 March 2022."
"Users, uses and context","The dwelling stock estimates provide annual base line information on the overall amount of housing stock at a Wales and local authority level. It is used as evidence for policy making by both central and local government. The data are used by the Welsh Government, local authorities and other housing organisations to help monitor trends in the overall level of Welsh housing stock, as well as any changes in its tenure distribution over time. Outside of government the dwelling stock estimates are used by the finance and investment industries, for example to help develop a picture of demographic trends."
"Rounding applied","Due to the uncertainty around the estimates, figures have been rounded to the nearest 100. 

Due to the way in which the APS proportions have been applied, the Wales total may not equal the sum of the local authority numbers (and regions) for some tenures. The regional figures are calculated as the sum of the local authority numbers. 

Some tenure breakdown percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding."
"Revisions information","Data for 2012-2020 has been revised. Following the publication of the Census 2021 dwellings data, dwelling stock estimates have been recalibrated against the Census 2021 dwellings count to ensure consistency with both the previous and latest census. Further details are available in the statistical release. "
